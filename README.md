# Java-vs-Go-Comparision
Java vs Go Benchmark

Combined Pattern (Best Practice)

```
Vendor Service
   ├─ gRPC → Document Service (start doc process)
   └─ Kafka publish: vendor.submitted

Document Service
   ├─ Kafka consume: vendor.submitted
   ├─ gRPC → Rule Engine (evaluate)
   └─ Kafka publish: document.processed

Rule Engine
   ├─ Kafka consume: document.processed
   └─ Kafka publish: vendor.validated

Vendor Service
   └─ Kafka consume: vendor.validated → update status

```
Result:

- Instant internal calls when needed (gRPC)

- Never lose workflow state (Kafka)

- Replayable audit trail

- Loosely coupled services

This is the modern enterprise pattern used by Uber, Netflix, Stripe.

🧠 Why “only gRPC” won’t work

| Problem if gRPC only      | Impact                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| If one service down       | Whole chain breaks          |
| No event history          | No audit / compliance trace |
| No DLQ / retry            | Lost onboarding cases       |
| Hard to reprocess vendors | Rule change = no replay     |

🧠 Why “only Kafka” is not ideal

| Problem                 | Impact                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| User waiting?           | Hard to do live response        |
| OCR step latency varies | No way to sync decisions easily |

## Final Answer

> gRPC + Kafka = correct architecture
> for your vendor onboarding pipeline.

- gRPC for direct immediate processing
- Kafka for event durability + async reliability + scaling

Use choreography for technical pipeline (OCR/rules)
Use orchestration for approval workflow (Finance/Legal)
